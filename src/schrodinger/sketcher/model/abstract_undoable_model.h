/**
 * A base class for models where all changes are undoable using a QUndoStack.
 * Undoable methods can be defined by calling doCommand with redo and undo
 * lambdas.  For example:
 *
 * void MyUndoableModel::add(int value)
 * {
 *     auto redo = [this, value]()
 *     {
 *         m_sum += value;
 *         emit valueChanged(m_sum);
 *     };
 *     auto undo = [this, value]()
 *     {
 *         m_sum -= value;
 *         emit valueChanged(m_sum);
 *     };
 *     QString desc = QString("Add %1").arg(value);
 *     doCommand(redo, undo, desc);
 * }
 *
 * With the above definitions, any calls to `add` will immediately add `value`
 * to `m_sum` and will be undoable.
 *
 * Note that signals may only be emitted from inside a redo or undo.  Signals
 * emitted at other times will be blocked.  This is to make it easier to catch
 * bugs caused by accidentally emitting signals when a command is created
 * instead of when a command is executed (i.e. accidentally putting the emit
 * outside of the lambda instead of inside).
 *
 * Also note that doCommand must not be called from inside a redo or undo, as
 * this will raise an exception.  Without the exception, this would instead
 * result in a downstream crash.
